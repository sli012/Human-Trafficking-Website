 <h1><center>Crime Corruption And It's Parallels to Human Trafficking<center></h1> 
  <h3> Organized trafficking can’t take place without corruption</h3>

  <p class = "indent"> 1.) Human trafficking occurs within criminal gangs:</p>

  <h3> Corruption in the trafficking in person’s cycle</h3>

    <p class = "indent"> 1.) Allows the crime to be invisible
    </p>
    <p class = "indent"> 2.) Facilitates the impunity once cases of trafficking victims are detected:</p>
    <p class = "indent"> 3.) Facilitates the execution of crime</p>
    <p class = "indent"> 4.) can assure the re-victimisation of trafficked victims</p>

  <h3> Corruption being a crucial factor in human trafficking, its significance is in sharp contrast to the limited effectiveness of its prosecution. While action has been taken in various countries, there are still few structured policies or strategies in place for the prevention and investigation of these criminal practices.
  </h3>

  <p class = "indent"> 1.) Countries that do not did not fully comply with the minimum standards of anti-trafficking efforts set out in the Trafficking Victim Protection Act 2000, often had high percentages of corruption </p>

  <h3> Rings of Protection Around Criminal Networks
  </h3>

  <p class = "indent"> 1.) Many identified cases associated with trafficking involved facilitating the operation of the place of exploitation, as well as enabling entry into the country for victims and, in general, issuing documentation without requirements being met.
  </p>
  <p class = "indent"> 2.) There are also rings of protection at different levels which makes exploitation networks stronger. The first ring mainly involves police forces and municipal inspectors, who give protection to the organisations that control the places the exploitation occurs.</p>
  <p class = "indent"> 3.) Since human trafficking can form part of the structures in the criminal econcomy, there is a second ring of protection that possibly involves the prosecuters and political forces.</p>
  <p class = "indent"> 4.) A third ring can occur when corrupt officials’ position of power allows them to control the criminal business. For example, the CICIG (International Commission against Impunity in Guatemala) Report on Human Trafficking for Sexual Exploitation in Guatemala identifies cases of officials directly engaged in the trafficking business, operating through front men. They owned centres of sexual exploitation and laundered their profits by investing in transport and other businesses.
  </p>

  <h3> Sexual Extortion as Currency</h3>

  <p class = "indent"> 1.) This form of corruption is harder to to detect since it's “normalized” and carried on invisibly. It’s when the currency of payment of trafficking is not money, but sexual services.
  </p>
  <p class = "indent"> 2.) This form of sexual extortion, understood as an abuse of power to obtain sexual benefit, has a dual nature, as corruption and as a crime of sexual violence. This last condition presents challenges in terms of evidence, particularly with regard to the consent of the victims, and then there is stigmatisation to deal with, and the difficulties involved in protecting the women who dare to come forward to report these crimes.
  exploitation occurs.</p>

  <h3> Solutions for Solving Corruption and Human trafficking</h3>

  <p class = "indent"> 1.) Although breaking up criminal structures is not enough to end human trafficking, promoting a double look at areas of corruption and trafickking and generating joint protocols within prosecutor offices will help</p>

  <p class = "indent"> 2.) Prevention and early detection in places most prone to these crimes through risk analysis
  </p>

  <p class = "indent"> 3.) Making sexual extortion a visible crime of corruption and to generate solid actions to combat it.
