<h3><center>Connecting to Human Trafficking: <center></h3>
<p>1) Poverty is one of the factors that make humans vulnerable to trafficking </p>
<p>2) Due to poverty some parents sell their children -- over 32 billion dollars is made annual from human trafficking </p>
<p>3) Lack of resources increases the vulnerability of someone</p>
<p>4) Low income individuals are stated to be one of the most vulnerable population to human trafficking as poverty is a compelling factor</p>
<p>5) Low-income areas tend to be more dangerous because those suffering from poverty tend to be targets</p>
<p>6) Less than 40 billion dollars can end global poverty as living in poverty is a harsh reality to escape from and some people will do whatever it takes to escape it  </p>
<p>7) Traffickers also target those struggling to meet basic needs and have few economic opportunities</p>
<p>8) Over 35% of the worldâ€™s population is living on less than $2 per day, 2.5 billion people are at risk for trafficking</p>
<p>9) Most victims of trafficking are women and girls, in economically troubled countries where women hold low social status families often sell a girl child in order to have money to feed the rest of the family</p>
<p>10) Some women are lured into trafficking to find a better life for themselves or in some cultures to pay off a dowry </p>
