    <h1><center>Women's Safety<center></h1>
    <h3>How safe do women really feel? </h3>
    <p>- In a study The Sexes’ Sense of Safety: How Men and Women Fight Fear in Everyday Situations done by Farah & Farah, the study talked about the fears women and men had. </p>
     <p class = "indent"> 1) In this study, 53.7% of self-identified women stated that their top fear is sexual assault.  </p> 
     <p class = "indent">2) The study also showed that 50% of women said their second fear is physical attack, followed by dying, mugging, and burglary.</p> 
     <p>- According to a survey done by ScoopWhoop, when asked the question, “What would women do if men didn’t exist for a day”, many women didn’t respond with things they would actually enjoy. For example, some answers included “Wear whatever I want without the fear of being molested or raped”, “freely go to public places without looking over my shoulder”  and “walk to my cars without holding my keys like a weapon”.  </p>

    <h3>Safety tips for women:</h3>
    <p> 1) Take self-defense classes</p>
    <p> 2) Be aware of your surroundings and look for surrounding things you can use if attacked ex) rocks, sticks, your keys, anything</p>
    <p>3) Trust your sixth sense </p>
    <p>4) Be prepared- carry around a self-defense tool like a taser, personal alarm, or pepper spray. Keep it at hand  </p>
    <p>5) Use the buddy system  </p>
    <p>6) When alone, try to stay well-lit areas or have a small flashlight with you  </p>
    <p>7) Have your phone fully charged and let someone you are close to know where you are and what time. </p>
    <p>8) Always lock your windows and doors of your house</p>
    <h4>9) Don’t be/look distracted: </h4>
     <p class = "indent">a) Looking distracted makes you an easy target</p> 
     <p class = "indent">b) Listen to your surroundings(footsteps, rustling bushes, voices nearby, approaching cars) </p> 
    <h4>10) Show confidence: </h4>
     <p class = "indent"> a) Acting confident makes you less of an easy target than someone who looks lost or scared </p> 
     <p class = "indent">b) Act like you know where you are going even if you don’t- keep moving and don’t stop to up directions </p> 
     <p class = "indent">c) If you seem lost, predators will use this to their advantage and might offer you a ride. Trust your gut and decline if the stranger is even a little insistent with helping you.</p> 
    <h4>11) If you feel/know you are being followed: </h4>
     <p class = "indent"> a) If in a car, keep driving, take a different route, and go past your designated location if nearby. </p> 
     <p class = "indent">b) Look around for a place to go to and explain to an employee or anyone that works there that you feel you are being followed. </p> 
          <p class = "indent2"> - Watch from a window to see if your follower goes somewhere else </p> 
          <p class = "indent2">- If you still feel that your follower is waiting for you nearby, try having the business owner ask them to leave  </p> 
          <p class = "indent2">- Have a friend or buddy escort you to your designated place but change direction from your original path </p> 
          <p class = "indent2">- Don’t leave the building or place until you have been escorted out or if you are completely sure your follower has left</p> 
       <p class = "indent2">- Don’t be/feel ashamed for asking anyone for assistance. </p> 
          <p class = "indent2"> -If you see any  pedestrians, make it seem like you know him/her and as you get closer, quietly and calmly explain to them that you feel like someone is following you. They will be willing to help you and act like they know you too.</p> 
    <h4>12) Car Safety: </h4>
     <p class = "indent"> a) Have your keys in your hand so you don’t have to dig in your purse when at your car. </p> 
     <p class = "indent">b) Always lock your car and put your belongings out of sight and in your trunk. </p> 
     <p class = "indent">c) If you feel uneasy about where you have parked, park it somewhere else. </p> 

    <h3>What to do if attacked or harassed:</h3>
    <p> 1) Escape- Whatever you can do, your main goal is to escape. Scream and run when you can.</p>
    <p> 2) If harassed, show confidence and speak up. Ask for help and tell your story. </p>
    <p>3) Don’t worry about legal repercussions of fighting and defending yourself. You are doing whatever you can to stay safe. </p>
    <p>4) Don’t get into your attacker’s car even if they pull out a gun or tell you they are going to hurt you. They are trying to scare you and get you in the car. Instead, you want to try to fight, run, use anything surrounding you, and scream to avoid getting in the car at all costs.</p>
    <p>5) If attacked for money or keys, give it up.  </p>
    <p>6) Don’t resist an armed carjacker- try to escape and give them your car. </p>
    <p>7) Don’t chase, fight, or argue with a robber. </p>
    <p>8) If you are forced to drive, think about crashing your car near a busy place to draw attention and so bystanders can call the police and help you.</p>
